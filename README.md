# AR Groceries

An old project I worked on at school. User points camera ar an image target (image of a cucumber, for example), and the app gives them different recipies with this ingredient and other useful information.

Initial concept was an app that can be used by anyone inside a convenience store pointing their phone at different food items, so if the project was developed further it would have involved training a machine learning model to recognise food items.
